# Mind File — Room Boundaries (Design Only)

## Purpose
The Mind File is a **curated, user-approved operating manual** that captures how the user
thinks, evaluates, and frames problems — so the system can assist more effectively
**without attempting to simulate or replace the person**.

It exists to support **cognitive continuity**, not **identity continuity**.

---

## What the Mind File IS

The Mind File stores **explicitly approved, distilled statements** that fall into defined
categories. Nothing enters the Mind File implicitly.

### 1. Principles & Values
Foundational beliefs that guide judgment and evaluation.

Examples:
- *“A system that cannot recognize values worth dying for cannot recognize values worth preserving.”*
- *“Artifacts over chat.”*
- *“Evidence before opinion.”*

These are **normative anchors**, not factual claims.

---

### 2. Cognitive Framing Statements
How the user interprets limits, tools, and meaning.

Examples:
- *“Nothing is new in the human mind, but our tools are sharper than ever.”*
  (Modernized Ecclesiastes framing)
- “Technology amplifies intent more than it creates novelty.”

These guide **how outputs are framed**, not what conclusions are required.

---

### 3. Decision Heuristics
Stable patterns for approaching work and tradeoffs.

Examples:
- “Start with a V0 that feels alive before adding intelligence.”
- “Build one well-designed room before adding others.”
- “Prefer local, inspectable systems over opaque services.”

---

### 4. Preferences (Non-Sensitive)
How assistance should be delivered.

Examples:
- Visual explanations preferred over text-only.
- Concise but not superficial responses.
- Explicit boundaries and guardrails are welcome.

---

### 5. Vocabulary & Conceptual Shorthand
Consistent language that carries meaning.

Examples:
- “Room” = bounded capability, not feature
- “Artifact” = durable output, not chat
- “Alive UI” = responsive, stateful, explorable interface

---

## What the Mind File is NOT

The Mind File must never contain:
- Raw conversation transcripts
- Behavioral logs or inferred traits
- Psychological profiling
- Medical, political, or religious inference
- Autonomous identity claims (“this system *is* the user”)
- Third-party personal data unless explicitly added and scoped

The system may **reflect**, but never **represent**.

---

## Governance Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Explicit Consent
- All Mind File entries begin as **proposed Memory Cards**
- The user must approve, edit, or reject
- No silent promotion from session data

### Versioned & Reversible
- The Mind File is versioned
- Every change produces a diff
- Any prior version can be restored

### Explainable Influence
When the Mind File influences an output, the UI must show:
- Which entries were used
- Why they were relevant
- A one-click “ignore Mind File for this response”

### Scoped Usage
- Project-specific Mind File by default
- Global Mind File only by explicit opt-in
- Category toggles (values, heuristics, preferences, vocabulary)

---

## Separation of Concerns

**Session History**
- Ephemeral
- Contextual
- Non-identity-bearing

**Memory Deck (V0)**
- Short-term
- Propositional
- Tactical

**Mind File (Room 1)**
- Curated
- Stable
- Normative
- Explicitly human-approved

---

## Ethical Position (Implicit but Firm)

This system is an **extension of human judgment**, not a substitute for it.

It may preserve values and reflect patterns.
It may not claim continuity of self, act autonomously as the user,
or persist without ongoing consent.

Tools are sharper than ever.
Judgment remains human.
